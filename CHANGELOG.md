### Added
- Initial release of FastDependencyAnalyser Gradle plugin
- Bytecode analysis for dependency usage detection using ASM library
- Automatic dependency cleanup with build validation and rollback
- Support for multi-module Android/Kotlin projects
- Configurable exclusions via `dependency-analyser-config.yml`
- Comprehensive reporting with detailed and summary modes
- Two main tasks:
  - `checkDependencies`: Analyzes and reports unused dependencies
  - `cleanupDependencies`: Automatically removes unused dependencies with validation
- Support for various dependency formats:
  - Gradle 7+ project dependencies (`projects.library.api`)
  - Legacy project dependencies (`project(":library:api")`)

  - Direct dependencies (`"com.example:library:1.0.0"`)
- Smart cleanup algorithms:
  - Binary search for efficient removal of large dependency sets
  - Sequential removal for small sets (â‰¤3 dependencies)
  - Build validation with automatic rollback on failure
- Flexible configuration options:
  - Module-specific analysis (`-Pmodule=feature:home`)
